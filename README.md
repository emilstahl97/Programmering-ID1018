### Intended learning outcomes

Upon completion of the course the student is able to:

Analyze, explain, modify and expand a simple program in terms of fundamental programming constructs and concepts.
Describe the representation of numeric and character data, and discuss the use of primitive data types and built-in data structures.
Design, implement, test and debug a program using basic computation, simple I/O, standard conditional and iterative structures, and the definition of functions.
Discuss the importance of algorithms, identify the necessary properties of good algorithms and create algorithms for solving simple problems.
Develop code that responds to exceptional situations during execution.
Justify the philosophy of object-oriented design and the concepts of encapsulation, abstraction, inheritance, and polymorphism.
Design, implement, test, and debug simple programs in an object-oriented programming language.

### Course Disposition

The course runs over a KTH period. Teaching forms that are used:

Lectures. In a lecture (for all students) different concepts are introduced and developed.
Labs (programming exercises). The student solves different programming problems with the help of a computer, and in that way verifies and deepens her/his knowledge and abilities.
Seminars. Students prepare solutions to problems and discuss them in groups.
